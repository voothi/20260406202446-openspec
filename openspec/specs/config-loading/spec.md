# config-loading Specification

## Purpose
Define how `openspec/config.yaml` is discovered, parsed, validated, and exposed to callers with safe fallbacks.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Load project config from openspec/config.yaml

The system SHALL read and parse the project configuration file located at `openspec/config.yaml` relative to the project root. The parser MUST support standard YAML features including comments and block scalars, specifically ensuring that comments can safely terminate block scalars without causing syntax errors.

#### Scenario: Valid config file exists
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` exists with valid YAML content
- **THEN** system parses the file and returns a ProjectConfig object

#### Scenario: Config file does not exist
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` does not exist
- **THEN** system returns null without error

#### Scenario: Config file has invalid YAML syntax
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` contains malformed YAML
- **THEN** system logs a warning message INCLUDING the specific parsing error details and returns null

#### Scenario: Config file has valid YAML but invalid schema
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` contains valid YAML that fails validation
- **THEN** system logs a warning message with validation details and returns null

#### Scenario: Block scalar followed by comment
- **WHEN** config contains a block scalar (`|`) followed by a less-indented comment line
- **THEN** system correctly terminates the block scalar and ignores the comment without throwing a syntax error

### Requirement: Support .yml file extension alias

The system SHALL accept both `.yaml` and `.yml` file extensions for the config file.

#### Scenario: Config file uses .yml extension
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yml` exists and `openspec/config.yaml` does not exist
- **THEN** system reads from `openspec/config.yml`

#### Scenario: Both .yaml and .yml exist
- **WHEN** both `openspec/config.yaml` and `openspec/config.yml` exist
- **THEN** system prefers `openspec/config.yaml`

### Requirement: Use resilient field-by-field parsing

The system SHALL parse each config field independently, collecting valid fields and warning about invalid ones without rejecting the entire config.

#### Scenario: Schema field is valid
- **WHEN** config contains `schema: "spec-driven"`
- **THEN** schema field is included in returned config

#### Scenario: Schema field is missing
- **WHEN** config lacks the `schema` field
- **THEN** no warning is logged (field is optional at parse level)

#### Scenario: Schema field is empty string
- **WHEN** config contains `schema: ""`
- **THEN** warning is logged and schema field is not included in returned config

#### Scenario: Schema field is invalid type
- **WHEN** config contains `schema: 123` (number instead of string)
- **THEN** warning is logged and schema field is not included in returned config

#### Scenario: Context field is valid
- **WHEN** config contains `context: "Tech stack: TypeScript"`
- **THEN** context field is included in returned config

#### Scenario: Context field is invalid type
- **WHEN** config contains `context: 123` (number instead of string)
- **THEN** warning is logged and context field is not included in returned config

#### Scenario: Rules field has valid structure
- **WHEN** config contains `rules: { proposal: ["Rule 1"], specs: ["Rule 2"] }`
- **THEN** rules field is included in returned config with valid rules

#### Scenario: Rules field has non-array value for artifact
- **WHEN** config contains `rules: { proposal: "not an array", specs: ["Valid"] }`
- **THEN** warning is logged for proposal, but specs rules are still included in returned config

#### Scenario: Rules array contains non-string elements
- **WHEN** config contains `rules: { proposal: ["Valid rule", 123, ""] }`
- **THEN** only "Valid rule" is included, warning logged about invalid elements

#### Scenario: Mix of valid and invalid fields
- **WHEN** config contains valid schema, invalid context type, valid rules
- **THEN** config is returned with schema and rules fields, warning logged about context

### Requirement: Enforce context size limit

The system SHALL reject context fields exceeding 50KB and log a warning.

#### Scenario: Context within size limit
- **WHEN** config contains context of 1KB
- **THEN** context is included in returned config

#### Scenario: Context at size limit
- **WHEN** config contains context of exactly 50KB
- **THEN** context is included in returned config

#### Scenario: Context exceeds size limit
- **WHEN** config contains context of 51KB
- **THEN** warning is logged with size and limit, context field is not included in returned config

### Requirement: Defer artifact ID validation to instruction loading

The system SHALL NOT validate artifact IDs in rules during config load time. Validation happens during instruction loading when schema is known.

#### Scenario: Config with rules is loaded
- **WHEN** config contains `rules: { unknownartifact: [...] }`
- **THEN** config is loaded successfully without validation errors

#### Scenario: Validation happens at instruction load time
- **WHEN** instructions are loaded for any artifact and config has unknown artifact IDs in rules
- **THEN** warnings are emitted about unknown artifact IDs (see rules-injection spec for details)

### Requirement: Gracefully handle config errors without halting

The system SHALL continue operation with default values when config loading or parsing fails. Whenever possible, parse errors MUST be surfaced with sufficient detail to identify the problematic line in the configuration file.

#### Scenario: Config parse failure during command execution
- **WHEN** config file has syntax errors and user runs any command
- **THEN** command executes using default values (e.g., schema "spec-driven")

#### Scenario: Warning is visible to user
- **WHEN** config loading fails
- **THEN** system outputs a detailed warning message to stderr including the specific reason for the parsing failure
