# Update Command Specification

## Purpose

As a developer using OpenSpec, I want to update the OpenSpec instructions in my project when new versions are released, so that I can benefit from improvements to AI agent instructions.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Update Behavior
The update command SHALL update OpenSpec instruction files to the latest templates in a team-friendly manner.

#### Scenario: Running update command
- **WHEN** a user runs `openspec update`
- **THEN** replace `openspec/AGENTS.md` with the latest template
- **AND** if a root-level stub (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) exists, refresh it so it points to `@/openspec/AGENTS.md`

### Requirement: Prerequisites

The command SHALL require an existing OpenSpec structure before allowing updates.

#### Scenario: Checking prerequisites

- **GIVEN** the command requires an existing `openspec` directory (created by `openspec init`)
- **WHEN** the `openspec` directory does not exist
- **THEN** display error: "No OpenSpec directory found. Run 'openspec init' first."
- **AND** exit with code 1

### Requirement: File Handling
The update command SHALL handle file updates in a predictable and safe manner.

#### Scenario: Updating files
- **WHEN** updating files
- **THEN** completely replace `openspec/AGENTS.md` with the latest template
- **AND** if a root-level stub exists, update the managed block content so it keeps directing teammates to `@/openspec/AGENTS.md`

### Requirement: Tool-Agnostic Updates
The update command SHALL refresh OpenSpec-managed files in a predictable manner while respecting each team's chosen tooling.

#### Scenario: Updating files
- **WHEN** updating files
- **THEN** completely replace `openspec/AGENTS.md` with the latest template
- **AND** create or refresh the root-level `AGENTS.md` stub using the managed marker block, even if the file was previously absent
- **AND** update only the OpenSpec-managed sections inside existing AI tool files, leaving user-authored content untouched
- **AND** avoid creating new native-tool configuration files (slash commands, CLAUDE.md, etc.) unless they already exist

### Requirement: Core Files Always Updated
The update command SHALL always update the core OpenSpec files and display an ASCII-safe success message.

#### Scenario: Successful update
- **WHEN** the update completes successfully
- **THEN** replace `openspec/AGENTS.md` with the latest template
- **AND** if a root-level stub exists, refresh it so it still directs contributors to `@/openspec/AGENTS.md`

### Requirement: Slash Command Updates

### Requirement: Archive Command Argument Support
The archive slash command template SHALL support optional change ID arguments for tools that support `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

#### Scenario: Archive command with change ID argument
- **WHEN** a user invokes `/openspec:archive <change-id>` with a change ID
- **THEN** the template SHALL instruct the AI to validate the provided change ID against `openspec list`
- **AND** use the provided change ID for archiving if valid
- **AND** fail fast if the provided change ID doesn't match an archivable change

#### Scenario: Archive command without argument (backward compatibility)
- **WHEN** a user invokes `/openspec:archive` without providing a change ID
- **THEN** the template SHALL instruct the AI to identify the change ID from context or by running `openspec list`
- **AND** proceed with the existing behavior (maintaining backward compatibility)

#### Scenario: OpenCode archive template generation
- **WHEN** generating the OpenCode archive slash command file
- **THEN** include the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder in the frontmatter
- **AND** wrap it in a clear structure like `<ChangeId>\n  $ARGUMENTS\n</ChangeId>` to indicate the expected argument
- **AND** include validation steps in the template body to check if the change ID is valid

### Requirement: Update install scope selection
The update command SHALL support install scope selection for sync operations.

#### Scenario: Scope defaults to global config value
- **WHEN** user runs `openspec update` without explicit scope override
- **THEN** update SHALL use configured install scope
- **AND** if unset, SHALL resolve migration-aware default (`global` for newly created configs, `project` for legacy schema-evolved configs)

#### Scenario: Scope override via flag
- **WHEN** user runs `openspec update --scope project`
- **THEN** update SHALL use `project` as preferred scope for that run

### Requirement: Scope-aware sync and drift detection
The update command SHALL evaluate configured state and drift using effective scoped paths.

#### Scenario: Scoped drift detection
- **WHEN** update evaluates whether tools are up-to-date
- **THEN** it SHALL inspect files at effective scoped targets for each tool/surface
- **AND** SHALL compare current resolved scope against last successful effective scope for each tool/surface
- **AND** SHALL treat a difference as sync-required drift

#### Scenario: Scope fallback during update
- **WHEN** preferred scope is unsupported for a configured tool/surface
- **AND** alternate scope is supported
- **THEN** update SHALL apply fallback scope resolution
- **AND** SHALL report fallback in output

#### Scenario: Unsupported scope during update
- **WHEN** configured tool/surface supports neither preferred nor alternate scope
- **THEN** scope support SHALL be validated for all configured tools/surfaces before any write
- **AND** update SHALL fail without performing file writes when incompatibilities are detected
- **AND** SHALL report incompatible tools with remediation steps

### Requirement: Delivery sync by command surface capability
The update command SHALL synchronize artifacts using each configured tool's command surface capability.

#### Scenario: Commands delivery for adapter-backed configured tool
- **WHEN** user runs `openspec update`
- **AND** delivery is set to `commands`
- **AND** a configured tool has an adapter-backed command surface
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate or refresh command files for active workflows
- **AND** the system SHALL remove managed skill directories for that tool

#### Scenario: Commands delivery for skills-invocable configured tool
- **WHEN** user runs `openspec update`
- **AND** delivery is set to `commands`
- **AND** a configured tool has `skills-invocable` command surface capability
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate or refresh managed skill directories for active workflows
- **AND** the system SHALL NOT remove those managed skill directories as part of commands-only cleanup
- **AND** the system SHALL NOT attempt to require adapter-generated command files for that tool

#### Scenario: Commands delivery with unsupported command surface
- **WHEN** user runs `openspec update`
- **AND** delivery is set to `commands`
- **AND** a configured tool has no command surface capability
- **THEN** the system SHALL fail with exit code 1 before applying partial updates
- **AND** the output SHALL identify incompatible tools and recommended remediation

### Requirement: Configured-tool detection for skills-invocable command surfaces
The update command SHALL treat tools with skills-invocable command surfaces as configured when managed skill artifacts are present, including under commands delivery.

#### Scenario: Skills-invocable tool under commands delivery
- **WHEN** user runs `openspec update`
- **AND** delivery is set to `commands`
- **AND** a tool has no adapter-generated command files
- **AND** that tool is marked `skills-invocable` and has managed skills installed
- **THEN** the system SHALL include the tool in configured-tool detection
- **AND** the system SHALL apply normal version/profile/delivery sync to that tool

### Requirement: Update summary reflects effective per-tool delivery
The update command SHALL report effective artifact behavior when delivery intent and artifact type differ due to tool capability.

#### Scenario: Summary for skills-invocable tools in commands delivery
- **WHEN** update completes successfully
- **AND** delivery is `commands`
- **AND** at least one updated tool is `skills-invocable`
- **THEN** output SHALL include a clear note that those tools use skills as their command surface
- **AND** output SHALL avoid implying that command generation was skipped due to an error

## Edge Cases

### Requirement: Error Handling

The command SHALL handle edge cases gracefully.

#### Scenario: File permission errors

- **WHEN** file write fails
- **THEN** let the error bubble up naturally with file path

#### Scenario: Missing AI tool files

- **WHEN** an AI tool configuration file doesn't exist
- **THEN** skip updating that file
- **AND** do not create it

#### Scenario: Custom directory names

- **WHEN** considering custom directory names
- **THEN** not supported in this change
- **AND** the default directory name `openspec` SHALL be used

## Success Criteria

Users SHALL be able to:
- Update OpenSpec instructions with a single command
- Get the latest AI agent instructions
- See clear confirmation of the update

The update process SHALL be:
- Simple and fast (no version checking)
- Predictable (same result every time)
- Self-contained (no network required)
